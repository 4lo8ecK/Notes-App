# A To-Do List app
*       App saves data in files, every task is saved in each file
*       in the app start up load all this files and makes a list of tasks.
*       User is able to create new task, edit or delete task
*       also task is able to be marked as 'done'
*       
*       In future maybe will be created a multiuser version
*       I mean one user is not able to read other users' tasks
*       something like safety and one user can login as another user
*       in the same PC and login in the app will be able to enter his profile
*       
*       This app will have both GUI and terminal versions
*       terminal version is mostly will be used for testing the app
*       but both will be able to be used (they will be different apps)
